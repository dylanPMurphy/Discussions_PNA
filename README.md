Welcome to the Projects & Algorithms portion of your program! Having completed projects to unveil to the public is a vital first step toward displaying your skill sets.  Take the time today to think about and mention 1. What website(s) you wish you could have help build/maintain. 2. What website(s) you might take ideas from to build your own projects and why, 3. Pick a CSS framework you want to explore this month.      
```
I wish I could help build 
```
We're going to be hot and heavy into algorithm work alongside our solo projects.  We focus mostly on Arrays, which are considered a Data TYPE in various languages, and Singly Linked Lists, which are considered a Data STRUCTURE.  Explain the difference between a data type and a data structure in your own words and list at least two other data structures besides Singly Linked Lists.
```
Native data types are fundemental built in the underlying code that translates to lower levels.  Data structures are ways of organizing instances of those data types.

You should start considering how you might want your own portfolio to look when you complete your program.  Lots of our graduates produce great-looking portfolios shortly after they leave.  This is an important tool for marketing yourself and showcasing your talents and character to potential employers.  Do a quick Google search of web developer portfolios and pick out a few of your favorites. Enter 1-3 links to the various portfolios and a short description of what stands out about them.

What is a version control system and why would you want to use one?   
```
A version control system is a way in which to collaborate on a project without breaking the application.

Time to consider portfolios again.  There are lots of free services out there to help you launch an app, like Heroku and for a 12-month period, AWS.  But you also need to consider registering a domain.  We in the online staff have used namecheap.com, name.com, godaddy.com, Google Domains and others for procuring a domain name.  Most are very cheap, in the ballpark of $10 a year or less.  Netlify.com let's you do it for FREE. Do some shopping and find a domain service and domain name you want to get for yourself. Previous students have domains like hiremoe.com, danieltclancy.com, leibel.netlify.com, mickajohnson.com and others.  New domains like .tech, .live, .design, .ninja are coming out all the time too. Share the domain you've already grabbed or plan to grab and which provider you got it from!+


Career Services Check-In:  We have brilliant staff in our career services department who are ready to work with you as long as it takes to help you navigate the job search.  Once a Dojo student, ALWAYS a Dojo student.  With that said, do you plan to work with our career services staff and attend their workshops which will take place 1 week after your graduation date?  What concerns you most about this next step and getting out there in general?
